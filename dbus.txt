The "main" daemon owns the org.gtk.vfs.Daemon bus name
When the main daemon looses org.gtk.vfs.Daemon, it quits.

each "daemon" has a unique session bus id

Each daemon registers /org/gtk/vfs/Daemon which supports
operations like GetConnection and CancelOp on iface org.gtk.vfs.Daemon.

The main daemon supports ListMountpoints, iface org.gtk.vfs.MountpointTracker
at /org/gtk/vfs/MountpointTracker. It does this by tracking signals for availible
mountpoints and deaths of vfs daemons.

Each "mountpoint" in a daemon registers a org.gtk.vfs.Mountpoint iface
at a path like /org/gtk/vfs/mountpoint/N. It also signals availibility of this
mountpoint (with the bus id and the "uri prefix") at startup and when there is
a new owner of "org.gtk.vfs.Daemon".

At startup the client calls ListMountpoints to get a list of all active
mountpoints. It then continues to track changes by looking at signals for
availibility and daemon deaths.
