All info for mapping uri -> dbus name + remainder path is stored in config files read by the client at startup.

Each "mountpoint" in a mountpoint daemon owns a name like "org.gtk.vfs.mount.smb.$server.$share".
It also instantiates a Mountpoint interface at /org/gtk/vfs/mount/smb/$server/$share which
listens to operations.

Each daemon that contains at least one mountpoint also registers a org.gtk.vfs.Daemon interface
at /org/gtk/vfs/Daemon which supports operations like GetConnection and CancelOp.

Clients use GetNameOwner to map uri -> mountpoint name -> owner of name -> GetConnection call so that
it can handle multiple mountpoints in each daemon. This can be cached, and NameOwnerChanged can be used
to invalidate the cache.
