Implement the rest of g_file_info_simple_get:
* can_rename & can_delete
* icon

How do we represent icons in the APIs?
* Sometimes list of themed icon names
* handle e.g. win32 icons

Work on GFile

add get_file_info_async for FileStreams
Add async opens to GFile.
More GFile operations (rename, move, copy, etc)

add volume/drive GFile types and ops on them (mount/unmount/eject)

Add helper functions for reading/writing a whole file.

test outputstream (especially replace + backup) (and test everything else too)

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add GFilterOutput/InputStream and derivates (buffered, data, charset conversion, etc)

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon

implement seeks in local streams

pass cancellable to async callbacks?

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

smb support for xattrs!
smb support for hidden
smb - handle server going down

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing?

add trash support

Add info to mountpoints in smb-browser

Handle unmounted paths nicer in the API (i.e. an explicit not-mounted error)

modularize uri handling
decide how to handle not-mounted errors
handle mounting
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon

remove dbus-gmain.[ch]? We have no server integration in common/ atm

handle setting xattrs
handle non-ascii/utf8 xattr names by escaping

fs info - type, free space, total space
Do this via g_file_get_fs_info -> GFileInfo method?

HAL implementation of VolumeMonitor

Handle the conflicting globs (*.pcf) case and fallback to sniffing

Move GAppInfo to Gtk+

Add PRE_UNMOUNT file monitor event?

Add virtual file monitor event to support inotify WRITE_CLOSE

Add sort-priority file attribute so that e.g. volumes can be sorted not just by name

Make programmer errors be g_return_if_fail instead of GErrors

Return G_IO_ERROR_INVALID_FILENAME on local file operations on FAT with invalid names

FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
