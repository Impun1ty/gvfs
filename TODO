Catch EINTR in all syscalls

Implement the rest of g_file_info_simple_get:
* can_rename & can_delete
* mime type
* icon

Add Seekable support to LocalFile streams

Work on GFile

add get_file_info_async for FileStreams 

test outputstream (especially replace + backup) (and test everything else too)

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add GFilterOutput/InputStream and derivates (buffered, data, charset conversion, etc)

Make backend pluggable

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?

Sometimes we handle the dbus socket before the extra_fd one, need synchronization

figure out the right semantics for error or cancel of close()

Expose the seek operations on GInputStream also, not only via iface

Handle closing of stream protocol fd, on both sides.

Better, shorter class names...
