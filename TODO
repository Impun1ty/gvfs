Return std:icon for local files, etc

Work on GFile:
* More async operations

Implement the rest of the mountable GFile ops

Test g_file_replace_contents_async

Add filter streams: data, charset conversion, etc

implement seeks in local streams

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing?

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

handle setting xattrs on local files (and list the namespace as writable)
test xattrs
ensure only requested attrs are ever set
set xattr: and xattr_sys as writable namespaces
Why does xattr:* not work, but "xattr:" work in matcher?

Finish general attribute copy in gfile.c move fallback.
Think about atomic updates of several attributes.
gedit uses attr_copy_fd in libattr to copy xattrs
handle attributes in atomic save backup copy
GFileCopyFlags could have a FAIL_ON_ATTRIBUTE_COPY?

Set owner:user, owner:group for local files

HAL implementation of VolumeMonitor

Handle the conflicting globs (*.pcf) case and fallback to sniffing

Move GAppInfo to Gtk+

Add PRE_UNMOUNT file monitor event?

Add virtual file monitor event to support inotify WRITE_CLOSE

Add sort-priority file attribute so that e.g. volumes can be sorted not just by name

Make copy handle things like symlinks

gvfs:
====

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon, needs marshalling attributes over custom protocol

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

smb support for smbc_getxattr!
smb - handle server going down

add trash:/// support 

decide exactly how to handle not-mounted errors and make sure its consistent.
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon.

remove dbus-gmain.[ch]? We have no server integration in common/ atm

Make built-in uri parsers link into gvfs shared lib instead of using a module

FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
