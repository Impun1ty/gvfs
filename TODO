Implement the rest of g_file_info_simple_get:
* can_rename & can_delete
* mime type
* icon

Work on GFile

add get_file_info_async for FileStreams
Add async opens to GFile.
More GFile operations (rename, move, copy, etc)

test outputstream (especially replace + backup) (and test everything else too)

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add GFilterOutput/InputStream and derivates (buffered, data, charset conversion, etc)

Expose the seek operations on GInputStream also, not only via iface

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon

implement seeks in local streams

pass cancellable to async callbacks?

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

Handle unmounted paths nicer in the API (i.e. an explicit not-mounted error)

Change all error handling to be more consistent and sane.
 - better enums. Not use G_FILE?
 - how to handle "error chaining"
 - sane consistent not-mounted errors

Consider something like GnomeVFSVolumeMonitor and Volume/Drive

merge JobSeekRead/Write and JobCloseReadWrite ?

smb support for xattrs!
smb support for hidden
smb - handle server going down

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing?

Add info to mountpoints in smb-browser

modularize uri handling
decide how to handle not-mounted errors
handle mounting
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon

remove dbus-gmain.[ch]? We have no server integration in common/ atm

gvfserror => gioerror?
  
FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
