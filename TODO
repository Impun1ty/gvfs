Catch EINTR in all syscalls

Implement the rest of g_file_info_simple_get:
* can_rename & can_delete
* mime type
* icon

Add Seekable support to LocalFile streams

Work on GFile

add get_file_info_async for FileStreams 

test outputstream (especially replace + backup) (and test everything else too)

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add GFilterOutput/InputStream and derivates (buffered, data, charset conversion, etc)

Make backend pluggable

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?

Sometimes we handle the dbus socket before the extra_fd one, need synchronization

Do we really need g_output_stream_write, or will everyone want g_output_stream_write_all()?
For read its useful, to get whatever is availible for now (say for console input), but output?
Isn't it mainly useful to implement async writes, which we have a real API for?

-------------

continue on GVfsJobOpenForRead, especially the return part
