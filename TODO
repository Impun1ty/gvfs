Work on GFile:
* More async operations:
   get_filesystem_info
   set_display_name
   set_attribute
   set_attributes_from_info
   delete_file
   trash
   make_directory
   make_symbolic_link
   copy
   move

HAL implementation of VolumeMonitor (as a giomodule)

Move GAppInfo to Gtk+

Implement PRE_UNMOUNT for file monitors, send it when unmounting

Finalise the mimetype decision. Add fast version? See dfaure discussion on xdg list.
Implement std:icon for local files. This is related to mimetype decisions (fast vs slow)
Handle the conflicting globs (*.pcf) case and fallback to sniffing

Use giomodules for fam volume monitor backend

Add more filter streams: data reading, conversion (with general converter interface)
 => gicmo is working on this

Implement dummy GFile fallback for non-existing uris (both for local and gvfs)
 
gvfs:
====
	
Implement the rest of the mountable GDaemonFile ops:
   unmount_mountable
   eject_mountable

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement seek & truncate

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon, needs marshalling attributes over custom protocol

finish implementing copy progress callbacks

implement stuff in GDaemonVolume / GDaemonVolumeMonitor

convert GDaemonFiles to fuse paths on request

detect fuse paths and reverse map back to GDaemonFile

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

smb support for smbc_getxattr!
smb - handle server going down

add trash:/// support 

decide exactly how to handle not-mounted errors and make sure its consistent.
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon.

Make built-in uri parsers link into gvfs shared lib instead of using a module

FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing? How would you know this though?

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
