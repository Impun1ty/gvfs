Implement the rest of g_file_info_simple_get:
* can_rename & can_delete
* mime type
* icon

Work on GFile

add get_file_info_async for FileStreams 

test outputstream (especially replace + backup) (and test everything else too)

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add GFilterOutput/InputStream and derivates (buffered, data, charset conversion, etc)

Expose the seek operations on GInputStream also, not only via iface

Add async opens to GFile.

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon

implement daemon write stream, maybe break out common parts of gvfsreadstream to gvfsjobstream

implement seeks in local streams

pass cancellable to async callbacks?

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

Handle unmounted paths nicer in the API (i.e. an explicit not-mounted error)

Change all error handling to be more consistent and sane.
 - better enums. Not use G_FILE?
 - how to handle "error chaining"
 - sane consistent not-mounted errors
 
FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
