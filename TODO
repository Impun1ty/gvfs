Implement the rest of g_file_info_simple_get:
* can_rename & can_delete
* mime type
* icon

Work on GFile

add get_file_info_async for FileStreams 

test outputstream (especially replace + backup) (and test everything else too)

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add GFilterOutput/InputStream and derivates (buffered, data, charset conversion, etc)

Make backend pluggable

Expose the seek operations on GInputStream also, not only via iface

Add async opens to GFile.

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon

implement daemon write stream, maybe break out common parts of gvfsreadstream to gvfsjobstream

implement seeks in local streams

pass cancellable to async callbacks?

rename glib lib from gvfs to gio (since it has more than gvfs)

G_TYPE_VFS... -> G_VFS_TYPE...

add _hash and _equal to GFile

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

Handle unmounted paths nicer in the API (i.e. an explicit not-mounted error)

Don't export struct stat in API, its size depends on OS and lfs defines...

FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
