Work on GFile:
* More async operations

Implement the rest of the mountable GFile ops

Test g_file_replace_contents_async

Add filter streams: data, charset conversion, etc

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing?

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

GFileCopyFlags could have a FAIL_ON_ATTRIBUTE_COPY?

HAL implementation of VolumeMonitor

Move GAppInfo to Gtk+

Add PRE_UNMOUNT file monitor event?

Add virtual file monitor event to support inotify WRITE_CLOSE

Add sort-priority file attribute so that e.g. volumes can be sorted not just by name

Finalise the mimetype decision. Add fast version? See dfaure discussion on xdg list.
Implement std:icon for local files. This is related to mimetype decisions (fast vs slow)
Handle the conflicting globs (*.pcf) case and fallback to sniffing

gvfs:
====
	
implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon, needs marshalling attributes over custom protocol

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

smb support for smbc_getxattr!
smb - handle server going down

add trash:/// support 

decide exactly how to handle not-mounted errors and make sure its consistent.
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon.

remove dbus-gmain.[ch]? We have no server integration in common/ atm

Make built-in uri parsers link into gvfs shared lib instead of using a module

FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
