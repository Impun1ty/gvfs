How do we represent icons in the APIs?
* Where: file-info, volumes/drives, mime info
* should support list of themed icon names
* should support win32 icons
* should support custom icons (i.e. via http/dav)
  encode data or have a reference to something you can download via gio???
  file formats?
* icons should be cachable, at specific *source* sizes (i.e. not the scaled image for the requested size)
* loading icons must be done in gtk+, and requires extra info like the theme to use

Work on GFile:
* More async operations

Implement the rest of the mountable GFile ops

Add g_file_set_contents_async

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add filter streams: data, charset conversion, etc

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon, needs marshalling attributes over custom protocol

implement seeks in local streams

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

smb support for smbc_getxattr!
smb - handle server going down

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing?

add trash:/// support 

decide exactly how to handle not-mounted errors and make sure its consistent.
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon.

remove dbus-gmain.[ch]? We have no server integration in common/ atm

handle setting xattrs on local files
handle non-ascii/utf8 xattr names by escaping

HAL implementation of VolumeMonitor

Handle the conflicting globs (*.pcf) case and fallback to sniffing

Move GAppInfo to Gtk+

Add PRE_UNMOUNT file monitor event?

Add virtual file monitor event to support inotify WRITE_CLOSE

Add sort-priority file attribute so that e.g. volumes can be sorted not just by name

Make programmer errors be g_return_if_fail instead of GErrors

Return G_IO_ERROR_INVALID_FILENAME on local file operations on FAT with invalid names

Make built-in uri parsers link into gvfs shared lib instead of using a module

test everything

Add something like:
GFileAttributes *  g_file_query_attributes           (GFile                  *file,
						      GCancellable           *cancellable,
						      GError                **error);
Returns writable attributes supportable.
Use this to copy xattrs in general move fallback.

document type for file attrs
Get rid of std:flags, split it up to avoid problems with unknow flag values
Set owner:user, owner:group for local files
						      
FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
