Return std:icon for local files, etc

Work on GFile:
* More async operations

Implement the rest of the mountable GFile ops

Add g_file_set_contents_async

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add filter streams: data, charset conversion, etc

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon, needs marshalling attributes over custom protocol

implement seeks in local streams

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

smb support for smbc_getxattr!
smb - handle server going down

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing?

add trash:/// support 

decide exactly how to handle not-mounted errors and make sure its consistent.
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon.

remove dbus-gmain.[ch]? We have no server integration in common/ atm

handle setting xattrs on local files (and list the namespace as writable)
Split user.* and system.* into two namespaces?
handle non-ascii/utf8 xattr names by escaping

handle setting mtime, ctime, etc for local files

HAL implementation of VolumeMonitor

Handle the conflicting globs (*.pcf) case and fallback to sniffing

Move GAppInfo to Gtk+

Add PRE_UNMOUNT file monitor event?

Add virtual file monitor event to support inotify WRITE_CLOSE

Add sort-priority file attribute so that e.g. volumes can be sorted not just by name

Make programmer errors be g_return_if_fail instead of GErrors

Return G_IO_ERROR_INVALID_FILENAME on local file operations on FAT with invalid names

Make built-in uri parsers link into gvfs shared lib instead of using a module

Add flags to the query attribute calls, add SHOULD_COPY flag.
Finish general attribute copy in gfile.c move fallback.
Think about atomic updates of several attributes.
gedit uses attr_copy_fd in libattr to copy xattrs
handle attributes in atomic save backup copy
GFileCopyFlags could have a FAIL_ON_ATTRIBUTE_COPY?

Get rid of std:flags, split it up to avoid problems with unknow flag values
Add std:is_backup flags
Set owner:user, owner:group for local files


document create time vs change time vs mtime, etc

Fix crash on "gvfs-ls smb://WORKGROUP/SERVER", (maybe also when running gvfs-ls on unmounted shares?)

FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
