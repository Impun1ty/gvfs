Implement the rest of g_file_info_simple_get:
* can_rename & can_delete
* mime type
* icon

Work on GFile

add get_file_info_async for FileStreams
Add async opens to GFile.
More GFile operations (rename, move, copy, etc)

Make direct callbacks in stream async calls auto-add-idle

test outputstream (especially replace + backup) (and test everything else too)

getting selinux attrs is a bit slow, it does all sort of weird ops.

Add GFilterOutput/InputStream and derivates (buffered, data, charset conversion, etc)

implement readahead in GVFSReadStream, time difference

implement get_file_info for GFileInputStreamDaemon

implement seeks in local streams

pass cancellable to async callbacks?

remove owners from bus_name_map when they fail

smb support for xattrs!
smb support for hidden
smb - handle server going down

is-slow marking for e.g. thumbnailing?

Add info to mountpoints in smb-browser

Handle unmounted paths nicer in the API (i.e. an explicit not-mounted error)

modularize uri handling
decide how to handle not-mounted errors
handle mounting
mount daemons should re-register when new owner for vfs daemon

remove dbus-gmain.[ch]? We have no server integration in common/ atm

handle setting xattrs
handle non-ascii/utf8 xattr names by escaping

fs info - type, free space, total space

HAL implementation of VolumeMonitor

Handle the conflicting globs (*.pcf) case and fallback to sniffing

Move GAppInfo to Gtk+

FUTURE IDEAS:
-------------

local file access through the daemon for remote X clients?
